Along with [Guy D. Whitten](https://pols.tamu.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/guy-d-whitten-professor/) and [Laron K. Williams](http://web.missouri.edu/~williamslaro/), I have a recently published article in [_Political Science Research and Methods_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods). Check it out [here](https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2019.9).
