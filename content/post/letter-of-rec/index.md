# So You Need a Letter?

I am often asked to write letters of recommendation for students. This is an important part of our jobs as professors, but I often find myself struggling to write the letter I think the student needs because my experience with them is either limited to a single course or otherwise negative. I encourage students to consider reading this [post by Chris Blattman](https://chrisblattman.com/letters/) before asking a professor for a letter. It obviously never hurts to ask, but it may also be worth having a discussion with the professor about what sort of letter you can expect based on their experience with you. I am always happy to have that discussion.
